  <h1 class="Info">ABOUT THE BREWERY </h1>
  <h2 class="Info2">Handcrafted, Small Batch Brewed</h2>
  <p id="p">Nestled in the heart of Muskoka, Muskoka Brewery handcrafts premium beers as unique and refreshing as the region they’re from.
Founders Gary McMullen and Kirk <br> Evans kicked open the doors of Muskoka Brewery in June of 1996. Currently owned and operated by Todd Lewin and Bob MacDonald, what started as a very small and <br> dedicated team has quickly grown to a passionate band of beer lovers more than 130 strong.
In short, we have a passion for great beer and we hope you get a chance to <br> enjoy it.

    <p>There is only one Muskoka. It is a special place where rugged granite outcrops and lonely <br> blockquote windswept pines meet the shimmering beauty of freshwater lakes. Unspoiled <br> natural beauty is what people find here in Muskoka. This place is our home. It is at the <br> heart of what we brew.
 
  <br>  Go ahead, taste it. <br><br>
